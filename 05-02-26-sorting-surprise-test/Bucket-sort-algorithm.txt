BUCKET SORT

Step 1:
Create n empty buckets, where n is the number of elements in the array.

Step 2:
For each element x in the array, compute the bucket index as:
index = floor(n * x)
Insert x into bucket[index].

Step 3:
After inserting all elements into their respective buckets,
sort each bucket using a stable sorting algorithm.

Step 4:
Concatenate all buckets in order from index 0 to n-1
to obtain the sorted array.

DRY RUN:

arr = [0.73, 0.45, 0.78, 0.32, 0.89, 0.12, 0.74, 0.56, 0.45, 0.33]
n = 10

Bucket index = floor(n * element)

0.73 * 10 = 7.3  -> bucket 7
0.45 * 10 = 4.5  -> bucket 4
0.78 * 10 = 7.8  -> bucket 7
0.32 * 10 = 3.2  -> bucket 3
0.89 * 10 = 8.9  -> bucket 8
0.12 * 10 = 1.2  -> bucket 1
0.74 * 10 = 7.4  -> bucket 7
0.56 * 10 = 5.6  -> bucket 5
0.45 * 10 = 4.5  -> bucket 4
0.33 * 10 = 3.3  -> bucket 3

Buckets after insertion:

Bucket 0: []
Bucket 1: [0.12]
Bucket 2: []
Bucket 3: [0.32, 0.33]
Bucket 4: [0.45, 0.45]
Bucket 5: [0.56]
Bucket 6: []
Bucket 7: [0.73, 0.78, 0.74]
Bucket 8: [0.89]
Bucket 9: []

After sorting each bucket:

Bucket 3: [0.32, 0.33]
Bucket 4: [0.45, 0.45]
Bucket 7: [0.73, 0.74, 0.78]

Final sorted array after concatenation:

[0.12, 0.32, 0.33, 0.45, 0.45, 0.56, 0.73, 0.74, 0.78, 0.89]
